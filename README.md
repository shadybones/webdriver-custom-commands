# webdriver-custom-commands
WebDriver is cool, but I want to be able to create my own commands which will be run in the browser. So I did. It was not straight forward to do so; I suspect this is case of negligence on the part of WD developers - cuz wanting to do this has to be super common. Created with WebDriver 2.41.0, updated to use 2.45.0.

The code is good but I may have forgotten to dot an "I" or cross a "T" somewhere.
